How does this script work?

This script generates passwords for users while following certain criteria to ensure a unique and strong password is produced each time. Moreover, the script produces 20-character passwords that are chosen randomly from four main arrays. lowercase, uppercase, special symbol, and integer. In addition, each password produced will use at least one character from each group up until it fulfills the 20-character password. Moreover, this script is different from others that are already available as it ensures the passwords produced will not have a predictable pattern, especially at the beginning. Please keep in mind that this script cannot generate a password with fewer than 5 characters. 


Why do I feel like code generator is important?

I think a script like a random password generator is becoming more essential as we daily rely on the internet. Many of the websites we visit require us to create an email and password, and it is a good security practice to have a different password for each account created so that intruders do not have access to more than one account if they are compromised. Moreover, it’s hard to always come up with a password that fits all criteria, which include special digits, symbols, lowercase, and uppercase. Hence, my script generates a password for users.
